Hey There, this Natours project.
It is based on imaginary company/ institution providing package for different types of tours across various nature packed places.

It is a project based on backend development and server side rendering of a website. NodeJS and Expressjs is used for main API development and routing, while MongoDB is used as database where DB is hosted on cloud(ATLAS). 

Its main feature contains displaying of different types of tours, users & their comment as well. It also has authentication via google which is used to authenticate different users and also has payment method which could be used for real transaction.

"PS: Its not optimized for being responsive tho :("

This project follows Jonas Schedtmann "The complete bootcamp: Nodejs,expressjs,mongodb."
